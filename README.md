# Daiscover: Flower Identification
Created with CreateML  
Source code for my iOS app that uses a deep learning image classifier to classify over 102 different species of flowers. Trained on a self augmented version of the VGG Flower dataset.

## Dataset
To create the datset for training with Apple's CreateML, I used the large VGG Flower dataset (found here http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) along with around 100-200 suplemental images dowloaded from Google for each of the categories.
